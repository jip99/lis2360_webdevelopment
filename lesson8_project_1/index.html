                <h2><em>An Overview</em></h2>
                <p>From your class materials to your important documents, it is <b>vital</b> to keep things organized. Without a sense of organization
                to keep things easily accessbile, things are bound to be lost and inaccessible, resulting in potential troubles and chaos. The concept
                of databases follows this same philosophy, where they are crucial in keeping everything they handle, from credit card accounts to
                confidential government documents, in an organized, concise, and practical system to prevent these bad situations from occurring.</p>
                
                <p>But what exactly are we talking about when referring to a "database"? According to Techopedia, they define databases as being 
                organized collections of data that allow data to be easily accessible, manipulated, and updated. Essentially, you can think of
                databases being like a <i>very</i> big virtual filing cabinet.</p>
                
                <p>So what is one of the biggest advantages of having these databases? It's hard to narrow it down to just one advantage, as it is
                mutually agreed among many that their are several advantages, but one of the most prominent advantages that is always mentioned is
                highlighted by RingLead. They say that databases have the advantage of better access to data, where with querys, or requests, access
                is faster and more accurate. If anything, businesses rely on convenient and quick methods to attain what they need, so this is a very
                notable advantage.</p>
                
                <p>Another well-received advantage on why databases are beneficial lies in the pay of those who work with them. According to Glassdoor,
                the average salary of a database administrator is around eighty thousand dollars, with the higher offers easily making six-figures.
                With this in mind, businesses pay these consistent salaries to database workers since database management and maintenance is a highly
                desired skillset for growing businesses wishing to optimize their use of databases. The importance of these databases and how they must
                be properly treated can be summed up in this quote:</p>
                <blockquote><p><b>If you want a database, you don't go out and say you're going to write it. I see platforms as going in that direction. &nbsp
                ~Parker Harris</b></p></blockquote>
